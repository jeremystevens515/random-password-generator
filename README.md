# Random Password Generator
## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a random password generator for challenge 03 in the GA Tech full-stack coding bootcamp. The password generator takes input from the user and creates a password that is between 8 and 128 characters. This is accomplished by first prompting the user for how many characters they would like to use for their password. Once confirmed, they are asked a series of questions to determine if they would like to use lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, special charcters, and any combination thereof. Based on that input, a string of characters will be displayed on the screen.
